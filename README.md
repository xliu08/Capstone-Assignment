# Capstone-Assignment

Car accident happens every day due to many reasons, such as road condition, weather, and lighting, etc. In order to reduce the frequency of car collisions in Seattle, an analysis is conducted to predict the severity of a car collision that caused by the current weather, road and visibility conditions. The purpose of this analysis is to create a model that can alert drivers when the conditions are dreadful.

The dataset used for this project is presented by Seattle government, which recorded the collisions have taken place in Seattle since 2004. A full description for each variables can be found here. There are 38 variables and 194,673 observations in this dataset. This project focuses on analyzing the severity of a car collision. 

Three machine learning algorithms chosen for this dataset are:
1. Binary Logistic Regression: It is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable.
2. Decision Tree: It is a supervised machine learning classification algorithm that can split the data into subset based on an attribute value test.
3. K-Nearest Neighbors: It relies on labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new data. It helps to predict the severity code by finding the most similar to data point within k distance

Classification Report and Accuracy Score are used to evaluate each algorithm.
